            <p class="proj-text">I began my ceramics journey during the 2020 pandemic. This coincided with my undergraduate studies, where I found solace and inspiration in my first handbuilding course. As I transitioned into graduate school, my passion for ceramics deepened, leading me to learn the art of wheel throwing.
        While I have solidified my commitment to understanding, supporting, and building communities I also discovered a profound connection between my love for ceramics. The wedging table and wheel became not just tools for crafting clay but symbolic spaces where patience and commitment translated into beautiful forms.
        I have established her home studio. I am on a mission to define my unique artistic style through clay forms. I aim to share a narrative of clay and community, where each piece tells a story of patience, commitment, and the beauty that emerges when diverse elements come together. </p>
