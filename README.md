### Welcome

My strengths are in UX and typography. I am relearning how to code in HTML and CSS. 

This personal website was built using the Github community, tutorials, and the templates by https://imfunniee.github.io/

I am using it to host updates on my academic and artistic pursuits. I am a ceramicist and an up and coming DEI professional.

Feel free to take a look at the code. I can lead you to Google Scripts and SEO tutorials if you are interested in a similar set up.
